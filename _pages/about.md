After more than a decade in the food and beverages industry, I have decided to put my affinity for computers at work, focusing on Web & App development.
I recently finished Full Stack development course at John Bryce College.
Highly motivated, eager to learn and evolve.
I have adherence, determination and excellent interpersonal skills.
Open for a full-time position as a Full Stack developer.
